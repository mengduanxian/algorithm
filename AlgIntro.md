#### 历史背景

The term "Algorithms" goes back to Al Khwarizmi, who lives in Bacydud in the 9th century,

* wrote a book (in Arabic) on decimal number and how to 
  * add, subtract, multiply, divide
  * computer &radic;x
  * compute digits of π
* In short: the first book on algorithms.
  * Before that, it was all Roman Numerals. 

#### Algorithm 定义

* In mathematics and computer science an **algorithm**  is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
*  Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.(算法始终是明确的，并被用作执行计算，数据处理，自动推理和其他任务的规范。)

#### 注意

Any algorithm implies 3 questions: 

1. Is it correct?
2. How much time does it take as a function of input size n?
3. Can we do better? 

Often, space is an important consideration, too.
